# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design

**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**

The client, DriverPass, had a vision to create a project to help people pass the driving test. According to their owner Liam, many people are failing the DMV driving test. He has requested a system enabling users to purchase packages to practice behind the wheel, study the DMV guidelines, and take practice tests. When a user purchases a package, it will include limited driving lessons and an instructor to guide the customer. On the system's back end, DriverPass has also requested to have protected security to prevent malicious attacks, an IT officer to assist with password resets, and a secretary to help customers set appointments.

**What did you do particularly well?**

What I did exceptionally well was projecting the diagrams to understand the foundation and functionality of what the system should be. I spent countless efforts researching each diagram and ensuring each infrastructure was clear and concise. I also considered each diagram to ensure they were easy to read and avoided using any technical vocabulary.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

If I could choose a part of my work on the documents to revise, I would prefer to work on the UML Class Diagram. Looking back at the diagram, much more could have been implemented, including the class for the owner, the IT officer, and the DMV. The owner, Liam, would be able to view and generate the reports. The IT officer would have access to lock accounts, set up account information, and manage system functionality. Lastly, the DMV should have been included to update the DMV guidelines.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

I interpreted the user's needs by first reviewing the transcript of the interview and reviewing technical requirements. The user's needs were first implemented into the design, but inputting all the functions into a use case would help me visualize the criteria. Once the mandatory conditions were implied, I focused on the possible attributes that would help enhance the website's attractiveness to valued customers, such as security, simplicity, and clarity. Understanding the user's needs would determine how effective and successful the system is. We need to understand the vision to have a deep insight into the problem we are trying to solve.

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**

I am still new to understanding how to design software. However, my approach to developing software is to define all parts of the system that the client requests. From there, I would use the Gantt charts to help me visualize the time frames among the other diagrams, such as use case, activity, sequence, and class. Many lesson plans and techniques taught in this course were beneficial to implement as they showed a lot of real-life situations. I intend to retain all the knowledge and feedback provided by my instructor to improve myself in designing software.
